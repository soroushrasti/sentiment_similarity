## Dataset

For this project, dataset is gathered from:
https://www.kaggle.com/sunnysai12345/news-summary?select=news_summary_more.csv
Commonly, such datasets are used to train models that can summarize the text. Here I used for a different task.

## Objectives

I am going to build a news search model. The input is the summarized text headline. The output of the model should give the news articles ordered by relevance. So the goal of this project was to learn matching headlines with text.

## Codes

There are two codes in Python with two different approaches to solve the problem. Each has a short writeup on the algorithm and its performance. The implementation of the models are in tensorflow.

## Steps

The following steps are taken in this project

1. Data pre-process and cleaning.
2. Defining new variables and identifiers 
3. Model architecture
